PART 2. Trace

    ITERATION 1
      R1:A -> L apply. Raise flag1. Facts A, B, C and L.
    ITERATION 2
      R1:A -> L skip, because flag 1 raised.
      R2:L -> K apply. Raise flag1. Facts A, B, C and L, K.
    ITERATION 3
      R1:A -> L skip, because flag 1 raised.
      R2:L -> K skip, because flag 1 raised.
      R3:D -> A not applied, because RHS in facts. Raise flag2.
      R4:D -> M not applied, because of lacking D.
      R5:F,B -> Z not applied, because of lacking F.
